  i. Must Have
  -  As a busy student, I want to record my water consumption in a single tap so I can monitor my daily hydration without using a complex menu.
  -  As a student who frequently eats campus food, I want to search a pre-loaded database for cafeteria food so that I can accurately record the nutritional content of local meals.
  -  As a student with a limited budget, I would like to record the amount of money spent on a meal so that I can track my weekly expenditure.

  ii. Should Have
  -   As a health conscious person, I want to see a big "Calories Remaining" upon opening the app in order to be aware of my daily calorie allowance.

  iii. Could Have
  -    As a busy student, I want a quick add button to record my food within less than 30 seconds.
